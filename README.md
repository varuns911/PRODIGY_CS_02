# PRODIGY_CS_02
a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

# Image Encryption and Decryption using Pixel Manipulation

This Python script provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy

Install the required libraries using:

pip install pillow numpy
## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Run the script:

python Image_Encryption.py

3. When prompted, enter the full path to your image file.

4. The script will:
   - Generate a random encryption key
   - Encrypt the image and save it as "encrypted_image.png"
   - Decrypt the encrypted image and save it as "decrypted_image.png"

5. Check the output directory for the encrypted and decrypted images.
